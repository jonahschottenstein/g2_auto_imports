				<p>
					My name is Grant Glimcher, and I'm the founder of G2 Auto Imports.
					Growing up, I watched as strict safety and emissions regulations led
					manufacturers to produce increasingly uniform vehicles, often
					sacrificing style and creativity. While I have no issue with the
					efficacy of these vehicles, I aim to bring more fun, excitement, and
					variety to the roadsâ€”for the enjoyment of both owners and onlookers.
